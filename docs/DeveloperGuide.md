### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete S1234567X`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete S1234567X")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ImmuniMateParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ImmuniMateParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateCommand`) which the `ImmuniMateParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="auto" />



The `Model` component,

* stores the patient data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List all patients
#### Implementation

The `list` feature allows users to view all patients in the system through the `list` command. This patient data is then displayed in the system for the user to have an overview of all patients.
The `list` command is facilitated by `ListCommand` which extends the `Command` classes, listing all instances in the `Model`.

* `ListCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and listing all patients in the system.
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` is called to make the UI display all patients in the system.

Step 1. `ListCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `ListCommand` calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the filtered list of patients in the system.

Step 2. `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` is called to update the filtered list such that it shows all patients in the system. 

Step 3. The `ListCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

### Help
#### Implementation

The `help` feature allows users to view the link to User Guide. This command is facilitated by `HelpCommand` which extends the `Command` classes.

* `HelpCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and listing the link to the User Guide.

Step 1. Parser interprets the user's input and creates a new `HelpCommand` instance.

Step 2. `HelpCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `HelpCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult`, which signals the UI to display the help window .

### Create new patient
#### Implementation

The `create` feature allows users to create a patient by providing input through a command with specific arguments. This patient data is then stored within the system for future reference.
The `create` command is facilitated by `CreateCommand` and `CreateCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, storing a new instance of `Person` in the `UniquePersonList`.
* `CreateCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `CreateCommand` instance.
* `CreateCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and adding the new patient to the system.
* `ImmuniMate#addPerson(Person)` is called to add the patient to the internal list of patients.
* `UniquePersonList#add(Person)` is used to add the new patient to the system.

`ModelManager#addPerson(Person)` is called to add the patient to the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.addPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#add(Person)` to add the patient to the internal list of patients.

The command checks for duplicates in the system before adding the new patient.
* `Person#equals(Object)` is overridden to check if two patients are duplicates.
* `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` is used to check if the patient already exists in the system's list of patients.
* `ImmuniMate#hasPerson(Person)` is used to check if the patient already exists in the system.
`ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

The creation of `Person` instance also rely on field classes, such as `Name`, `Nric`, `Phone`, `Address`, `DateOfBirth`, `Sex`, and `Status`. Optional field classes include `Email`, `Country`, `DateOfAdmission`, `BloodType`, `Allergies`, `Conditions`, `Symptoms`, and `Diagnosis`.

Step 1. `CreateCommandParser` interprets the user's input, creates instances of fields which matches the input, and creates a new `CreateCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `CreateCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `CreateCommand` checks if the patient already exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If there is no duplicate, the patient is added to the system by calling `model.addPerson(person)`.

Step 4: After the patient is added, the `CreateCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a create operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![CreateState1](images/CreateCommandLogic.png)
Similarly, the following sequence diagram shows how a create operation goes through the `Model` component:
![CreateState1](images/CreateCommandModel.png)

### Delete patient
#### Implementation

The `delete` feature allows users to delete a patient by providing NRIC through a command. This patient data is then removed from the system.
The `delete` command is facilitated by `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, removing an instance of `Person` from the `UniquePersonList`.

* `DeleteCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `DeleteCommand` instance.
* `DeleteCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and removing the patient from the system.
* `ImmuniMate#removePerson(Person)` is called to remove the patient from the internal list of patients.
* `UniquePersonList#remove(Person)` is used to remove the patient from the system.
`ModelManager#deletePerson(Person)` is called to remove the patient from the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.removePerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#remove(Person)` to remove the patient from the internal list of patients.
`DeleteCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before removing the patient.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

Step 1. `DeleteCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC, and creates a new `DeleteCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `DeleteCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `DeleteCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If the patient exists, the patient is removed from the system by calling `model.deletePerson(person)`.

Step 4: After the patient is removed, the `DeleteCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a delete operation goes through the `Logic` and `Model` component:
![DeleteState1](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete patient information
#### Implementation

The `deleteinfo` command allows users to delete a patient's particular field of information by providing NRIC and the field to be deleted through a command. 
This `deleteinfo` command is facilitated by `DeleteInfoCommand` and `DeleteInfoCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, removing a particular field of information from the `Person` object.

* `DeleteInfoCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `DeleteInfoCommand` instance.
* `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and removing the field of information from the patient.
* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` is called to get the list of patients in the system.
* `Observablelist<Persons>#filtered(Predicate)` is called to obtain `Person` object of patient with specified NRIC.
* `Observablelist<Persons>#get(int)` is called to obtain `Person` object in the filtered list.
* `Person#setField` where `Field` refers to whichever field specified to be deleted, is responsible for removing the field of information from the patient.
  `DeleteInfoCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before removing the field of information.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

Step 1. `DeleteInfoCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC and the fields to be deleted, and creates a new `DeleteInfoCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `DeleteInfoCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If the patient exists, the `DeleteInfoCommand` calls `model.getFilteredPersonList().filtered().get()` to get the specified patients in the system.

Step 4. `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` check which fields are to be deleted, and remove the field of information using `Person#setField(null)`. Where `Field` is the field to be deleted.

Step 5: After the field of information is removed, the `DeleteInfoCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `deleteinfo` operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![DeleteInfoState1](images/DeleteInfoSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram for how the `deleteinfo` operation goes through the `Model` Component is as the following:
![DeleteInfoState1](images/DeleteInfoModelDiagram.png)

### Read a patient's information
#### Implementation
The `read` feature allows users to read a patient profile by providing NRIC through a command. This patient data is then displayed.
The `read` command is facilitated by `ReadCommand` and `ReadCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, displaying patient profile from an instance of `Person` from the `UniquePersonList`.

* `ReadCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `ReadCommand` instance.
* `ReadCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and displaying the patient profile from the system.
  `ReadCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before displaying patient profile.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate)` and is called to update the list to be of patient with specified NRIC in the system.
* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` is called to get the list of patient with specified NRIC in the system.
* `Observablelist<Persons>#get(int)` is called to obtain `Person` object of patient with speicified NRIC.  

Step 1. `ReadCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC, and creates a new `ReadCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `ReadCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `ReadCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If the patient exists, the patient is obtained from the system by calling `model.updateFilteredPersonList(person)`, followed by calling `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and `Observablelist<Persons>#get(int)`.

Step 4: After the patient is obtained, the `ReadCommand` formats the patient profile by calling `Messages.format(person)` and returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `read` operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![ReadState1](images/ReadCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

How a `read` operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:
![ReadState2](images/ReadCommandModelDiagram.png)

### Find patient
#### Implementation

The `find` feature lets users find patients with certain values in various fields, namely `name`, `address` and `condition`.
After a command with specific arguments as input, the patient list is filtered and the resultant list is shown.

The `find` command is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser`, extending the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively.
* `FindCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `FindCommand` instance.
* `FindCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command, calling `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)` to find patients with the given keywords in the given field.

Step 1. `FindCommandParser` interprets the user's input, determine which field the user wishes to find patients by, and creates a new `FindCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `FindCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. This in turn calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)`, which identifies patients having any of the keywords in `Predicate<Person>` in the given field.

Step 4: The `FindCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `find` operation goes through the `Logic` and `Model` components:
![ReadState1](images/FindLogicModelDiagram.png)

### Update patient fields
#### Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user types `update T0123456A a/35 Bishan Road, #10-40 con/myopia` command to update the address and condition fields in the profile of the person with `Nric` T0123456A in the address book. This calls `immuniMateParser.parseCommand()`, which separates the user input into the command `update` and the rest of the arguments.

Step 3. As the command `update` matches `UpdateCommand.COMMAND_WORD`, `UpdateCommandParser().parse()` is called, taking in the rest of the arguments. Here, the arguments are checked if they are null values, then passed into `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()`, where they are separated into `Nric` and other provided fields by finding their respective prefixes, and stored in an `ArgumentMultimap`.

Step 4. Still in `UpdateCommandParser().parse()`, checks are then done to verify the validity of the `Nric` and that no duplicate prefixes are found. A new `UpdatePersonDescriptor` object is then created to store the fields present in `ArgumentMultimap`.

Step 5. At the end of `UpdateCommandParser().parse()`, a new `UpdateCommand` instance is created with the `Nric` and `UpdatePersonDescriptor` as arguments. `UpdateCommand.execute()` is then called, taking in the ImmuniMate `model` as an argument.

Step 6. `model.getFilteredPersonsList()` retrieves the list of `Person`s stored, and a check is done to see if ImmuniMate has a `Person` with the given `Nric`.  This `Person` is then retrieved from the list, while a new `Person`  object is instantiated, with the `Person` and `UpdatePersonDescriptor` as arguments, representing the retrieved `Person` object with fields updated.

Step 7. `model.setPerson()` then replaces the retrieved `Person` object with the new `Person` object with fields updated, taking in both `Person` objects as arguments. The `model` is then saved into `storage`.

The following sequence diagram shows how an `update` operation goes through the `Logic` components:
![ReadState1](images/UpdateLogicDiagram.png)

How an `update` operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:
![ReadState2](images/UpdateModelDiagram.png)

### Add patient visit
#### Implementation
The `addvisit` feature allows users to add a patient visit by providing input through a command with specific arguments. This visit is then stored within the system for future reference.
The `addvisit` command is facilitated by `AddVisitCommand` and `AddVisitCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, storing a new instance of `Visit` in the `UniqueVisitList`.
* `AddVisitCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `AddVisitCommand` instance.
* `AddVisitCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and adding the new visit to the system.
* `ImmuniMate#addVisit(Visit)` is called to add the visit to the internal list of visits.
* `UniquePersonList#add(Visit)` is used to add the new visit to the system.
  `ModelManager#addVisit(Visit)` is called to add the visit to the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.addVisit(Visit)` which calls `UniqueVisitList#add(Visit)` to add the visit to the internal list of visits.
  The command checks if the patient exists in the system before adding the new visit of a patient.
* `Person#equals(Object)` is overridden to check if two patients are the same person.
* `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` is used to check if the patient exists in the system's list of patients.
* `ImmuniMate#hasPerson(Person)` is used to check if the patient exists in the system.
  `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient exists in the internal list of patients.
  The command checks for duplicates in the system before adding the new visit.
* `Visit#equals(Object)` is overridden to check if two visits are duplicates.
* `UniquePersonList#contains(Visit)` is used to check if the visit already exists in the system's list of visits.
* `ImmuniMate#hasVisit(Visit)` is used to check if the visit already exists in the system.
  `ModelManager#hasVisit(Visit)` is called to check if the visit already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasVisit(Visit)` which calls `UniqueVisitList#contains(Visit)` to check if the visit already exists in the internal list of visits.

The creation of `Visit` instance also rely on field classes`NRIC`, `Symptoms`,`Diagnosis`, `Status` and `DateOfVisit`.

Step 1. `AddVisitCommandParser` interprets the user's input, creates instances of fields which matches the input, and creates a new `AddVisitCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `AddVisitCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `AddVisitCommand` checks if the patient already exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If the patient exists, the `AddVisitCommand` checks if the visit already exists in the system by calling `model.hasVisit(visit)`.

Step 4. If the visit does not exist, the visit is added to the system by calling `model.addVisit(visit)`.

Step 4: After the visit is added, the `AddVisitCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a addvisit operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![AddVisitState1](images/AddVisitCommandLogic.png)
Similarly, the following sequence diagram shows how a addvisit operation goes through the `Model` component:
![addVisitCommandState1](images/AddVisitCommandModel.png)


### Check a patient's visit history
#### Implementation
The `check` feature allows users to check the visit history of a patient by providing NRIC through a command. This patient visit history is then displayed.
The `check` command is facilitated by `CheckCommand` and `CheckCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, displaying patient visit history from list of `Visit` from the `UniqueVisitList`.

* `CheckCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `CheckCommand` instance.
* `CheckCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and displaying the patient visit history from the system.
  `CheckCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before displaying patient visit history.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate)` is called to get the list of patient with specified NRIC in the system.
* `Model#updateFilteredVisitList(Predicate)` is called to get the list of visits with specified NRIC in the system.
  
Step 1. `CheckCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC, and creates a new `CheckCommand` instance. 

Step 2. The `CheckCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `CheckCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If the patient exists, the patient is obtained from the system by calling `model.updateFilteredPersonList(pred)`, followed by calling `model.getFilteredPersonList()` and `Observablelist<Persons>#get(int)`.

Step 4: Patient visit history is obtained from the system by calling `model.updateFilteredVisitList(pred)`, followed by `model.getFilteredVisitList()`.

Step 5: After the patient visit history is obtained, the `CheckCommand` formats the patient visit history by calling `Messages.formatCheck(visit)` and returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a delete operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![ReadState1](images/CheckCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
How a check operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:
![ReadState2](images/CheckCommandModelDiagram.png)

### Cluster Identification
#### Implementation

The `cluster` feature tells users if a certain location has a certain number of patients unwell with an illness.
Provided an integer, location and disease as inputs, it finds unwell patients having an address with the given location as a substring, and diagnosis with the given illness as a substring, and informs the user if the number of those patients is at least that integer.
The `cluster` command is facilitated by `ClusterCommand` and `ClusterCommandParser`, extending the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, storing a new instance of `Person` in the `UniquePersonList`.

* `ClusterCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `ClusterCommand` instance.
* `ClusterCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and separating the inputs into their categories (cluster size, address and illness). It calls `ModelManager#updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)` to find patients which satisfy the given criteria.

Step 1. `ClusterCommandParser` interprets the user's input, and separates it into its constituent categories, and creates a new `ClusterCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `ClusterCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. This in turn calls `model.updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person>)`, takes the location and illness keywords in `Predicate<Person>`, and finds all the patients which have them as substrings in their addresses and diagnoses respectively.

Step 4. This also calls `model.getFilteredPersonList().size()` to obtain the size of the patient group satisfying the given criteria.

Step 5: The `ClusterCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `cluster` operation goes through the `Logic` and `Model` components:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of patient information
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* works at a gp clinic or similar environments

**Value proposition**: As the number of patients a General Practitioner grows, information management might prove complex, especially so for personal data. ImmuniMate offers a way to record comprehensive information about every patient, while ensuring timely updates and avoiding duplications/contradictions.

## Planned enhancements
**Include FIN as accepted values for field `NRIC`**: The field `NRIC` should accept `F`, `M` and `G` as valid values, as they are valid first characters for foreigners' FIN (foreign identification number).

**Allow `Name` to take special characters**: The field `Name` should be able to accommodate names with special characters such as dashes, slashes, apostrophes etc.

**Limit `Country` to a list of valid countries**: The field `Country` should be limited to a list of countries, to prevent invalid entries.

**Make `Email` case-insensitive**: The field `Email` should be case-insensitive, as emails are not case-sensitive in practice.
