### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the patient data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create new patient
#### Proposed Implementation

The `create` feature allows users to create a patient by providing input through a command with specific arguments. This patient data is then stored within the system for future reference.
The `create` command is facilitated by `CreateCommand` and `CreateCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, storing a new instance of `Person` in the `UniquePersonList`.
* `CreateCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `CreateCommand` instance.
* `CreateCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and adding the new patient to the system.
* `ImmuniMate#addPerson(Person)` is called to add the patient to the internal list of patients.
* `UniquePersonList#add(Person)` is used to add the new patient to the system.
`ModelManager#addPerson(Person)` is called to add the patient to the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.addPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#add(Person)` to add the patient to the internal list of patients.
The command checks for duplicates in the system before adding the new patient.
* `Person#equals(Object)` is overridden to check if two patients are duplicates.
* `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` is used to check if the patient already exists in the system's list of patients.
* `ImmuniMate#hasPerson(Person)` is used to check if the patient already exists in the system.
`ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

The creation of `Person` instance also rely on field classes, such as `Name`, `Nric`, `Phone`, `Address`, `DateOfBirth`, `Sex`, and `Status`. Optional field classes include `Email`, `Country`, `DateOfAdmission`, `BloodType`, `Allergies`, `Conditions`, `Symptoms`, and `Diagnosis`.

Step 1. `CreateCommandParser` interprets the user's input, creates instances of fields which matches the input, and creates a new `CreateCommand` instance.

Step 2. The `CreateCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `CreateCommand` checks if the patient already exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.

Step 3. If there is no duplicate, the patient is added to the system by calling `model.addPerson(person)`.

Step 4: After the patient is added, the `CreateCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.
The following sequence diagram shows how a create operation goes through the Logic component:
Similarly, the following sequence diagram shows how a create operation goes through the Model component:
![CreateState1](images/CreateCommand.png)

### Delete patient
#### Proposed Implementation

The `delete` feature allows users to delete a patient by providing NRIC through a command. This patient data is then removed from the system.
The `delete` command is facilitated by `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, removing an instance of `Person` from the `UniquePersonList`.

* `DeleteCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `DeleteCommand` instance.
* `DeleteCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and removing the patient from the system.
* `ImmuniMate#removePerson(Person)` is called to remove the patient from the internal list of patients.
* `UniquePersonList#remove(Person)` is used to remove the patient from the system.
`ModelManager#deletePerson(Person)` is called to remove the patient from the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.removePerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#remove(Person)` to remove the patient from the internal list of patients.
`DeleteCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before removing the patient.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

Step 1. `DeleteCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC, and creates a new `DeleteCommand` instance.
Step 2. The `DeleteCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `DeleteCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.
Step 3. If the patient exists, the patient is removed from the system by calling `model.deletePerson(person)`.
Step 4: After the patient is removed, the `DeleteCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

### Delete patient information
#### Proposed Implementation

The `deleteinfo` command allows users to delete a patient's particular field of information by providing NRIC and the field to be deleted through a command. 
This `deleteinfo` command is facilitated by `DeleteInfoCommand` and `DeleteInfoCommandParser`. They extend the `Command` and `Parser` classes respectively, removing a particular field of information from the `Person` object.

* `DeleteInfoCommandParser#parse` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating a new `DeleteInfoCommand` instance.
* `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` is responsible for executing the command and removing the field of information from the patient.
* `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` is called to get the list of patients in the system.
`DeleteInfoCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system before removing the field of information.
* `ModelManager#hasPerson(Person)` is called to check if the patient already exists in the system. It calls `ImmuniMate.hasPerson(Person)` which calls `UniquePersonList#contains(Person)` to check if the patient already exists in the internal list of patients.

Step 1. `DeleteInfoCommandParser` interprets the user's input for NRIC and the fields to be deleted, and creates a new `DeleteInfoCommand` instance.
Step 2. The `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` is called by the `LogicManager`. The `DeleteInfoCommand` checks if the patient exists in the system by calling `model.hasPerson(person)`.
Step 3. If the patient exists, the `DeleteInfoCommand` calls `model.getFilteredPersonList()` to get the list of patients in the system. It then find the person with the specific NRIC by calling `Observablelist<Persons>#filtered(Predicate)` and `Observablelist<Persons>#get(int)`.
Step 4. `DeleteInfoCommand#execute` check which fields are to be deleted, and remove the field of information using `Person#setField(null)`. Where `Field` is the field to be deleted.
Step 5: After the field of information is removed, the `DeleteInfoCommand` returns the appropriate `CommandResult` to indicate the success of the operation.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of patient information
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: As the number of patients a General Practitioner grows, information management might prove complex, especially so for personal data. ImmuniMate offers a way to record comprehensive information about every patient, while ensuring timely updates and avoiding duplications/contradictions. It also seeks to establish links between patient for contact tracing and finding potential infectious clusters.

## Planned enhancements
**Include FIN as accepted values for field `NRIC`**: The field `NRIC` should accept `F`, `M` and `G` as valid values, as they are valid first characters for foreigners' FIN (foreign identification number).
**Make `email` case-insensitive**: The field `Email` should be case-insensitive, as emails are not case-sensitive in practice.
**Limit `country` to a list of valid countries**: The field `country` should be limited to a list of countries, to prevent invalid entries.
